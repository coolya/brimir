Brimir is a libary to define an work with meta models in TypeScript. It focues on providing a developer experience that is "native" to TypeScript developers. 
The library make heavy use of TypeScripts type level programming to make definitions of the meta model well integrated with other types. 

While the library is puiblished to npm registry, it is currently a proof of concept and everything is in flux. Prepare for regular breakage if you devide to 
play with it.
